# World of Warcraft theme for Jekyll

[Live example](https://forestguild.club) - theme was built for that website

## Under development

Right now that theme has a lot of hardcoded elements of [website](https://forestguild.club).

It will take some time to cleanup it. We don't push theme gem to rubygems because of that issue.

## Configuration

### `_config.yml`

TBD

### data files

That theme has so many config options, so we cant add them all to `_config.yml`, otherwaise it will be very VERY very huge.
So we decided to separate some things from `_config.yml` to data files in subdir (so your own data will not be affected).

# File structure with comments

## TBD
